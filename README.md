<h1>Python script for an e-Commerce product list</h1>

I was designing an e-commerce site that needed a product list based on cities and counties in California.

<h3>I found a data set for the entire US as a starting point</h3>

See the uscities.csv file

<h3>Final output required is a CSV file</h3>

Since this was a new business exploration, I decided to build the first iteration with Webflow's eCommerce tools. Webflow provides bulk uploading of products with a CSV file. Once you design all of the fields that you'll need for a product type, Webflow will provide the CSV format for uploading.

The script is quick and dirty, no need to optimize it for speed.

Good luck!
